        one of my biggest challenges is building a personal portfolio. never satisfied, it is always
        in a state of "work-in-progress." the result you see now is the present iteration—a snapshot
        of my current artistic direction.
      </p>
      <p className="br">
        my influences have been primarily brutalist and asian type design. for my portfolio, i
        focused on conveying the content respectfully. i'm still not satisfied, but i hope i've
        expressed myself properly.
